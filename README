ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Guido, a software engineer passionate about programming, mathematics, logic, and robotics. I've been tinkering with code since I was fourteen (and now at 36, I'm still as enthusiastic as ever!).

ðŸ’» My journey in software engineering has been a thrilling adventure, exploring the realms of logic and problem-solving through programming. I enjoy delving into the intricacies of algorithms, the elegance of mathematical concepts, and the challenge of implementing them in real-world applications.

ðŸ¤– My interest in robotics has been a driving force behind my exploration in software engineering. Building and programming robots to perform tasks and interact with the world is both fascinating and rewarding.

ðŸ§  I'm particularly keen on exploring neural networks, AI, and the intersection between software and autonomous systems. I believe in leveraging technology to solve complex problems and improve our world.

ðŸ“š When I'm not coding, you can find me buried in a good book on mathematics, exploring new problem-solving techniques, or occasionally, building something fun with my robotics projects.

ðŸŒŸ Feel free to explore my repositories and projects here on GitHub. If you have any questions, want to collaborate, or just want to chat about coding, mathematics, or programming, I'm always up for a good conversation!
